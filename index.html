    <h1>Best Playlists I've Made So Far</h1>
    <p> Continuing the now prevalent tradition of revealing the top 4 films as posted on letterboxd, I have the pleasure
      to anounce my top 4 playlists I've created on Spotify and why I think you should give them a chance using 4
      criteria and rating them from 1 to 10 (according to me because had no time to ask my friends).</p>
    <h2>CRITERIA:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nostalgia Factor: </strong>The playlist is able to transport back to a specific moment in life.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional Conection: </strong> The playlist's potential to evoke feelings or be associated with
        specific mood or emotions.</li>
      <li><strong>Versatility: </strong> The playlist is good enough on its own to be shared in public to people I'm not
        familiar with.</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural and Generational Identity (CGI): </strong>Related to growing up in Colombia during the 00s.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>NOW, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO...</p>

        <p> M&utilde;sica para planchar (Music to listen to while ironing clothes) is not a music genre itself but a selection of romantic songs or latin ballads made during the 70-90s. It includes songs by Amanda Miguel, Selena, Luis Miguel, Camilo Sesto, Yuri and Jeanette among others. Although many spotify playlists were created recently including these songs, these are my personal favorites and I always listen to them while painting, doing printmaking or whenever I go to karaoke. </p>
